That's in touch,
and that's full time.

3
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,734
Better luck next time, buddy.

4
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,509
Three cheers
for the South London Stags.

5
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:30,475
- Hip Hip...
- Hooray.

6
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,132
- Hip Hip.
- Hooray.

7
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,651
- Hip Hip.
- Hooray.

8
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,239
- Good game, boys.

9
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,559
- Chin up, boys.

10
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:48,045
That was a great game.

11
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,012
Yeah, it was close, so I
don't want you worrying

12
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:52,256
about the score line.

13
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,705
Those fat, straight old blokes,

14
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,673
they've been playing a
lot longer than you have.

15
00:02:55,707 --> 00:03:00,229
But, as first games go, it
was really fucking great.

16
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,474
You were aggressive, you
supported each other,

17
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:07,443
and you held your own against
a much more experienced side.

18
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,723
It's a great start to the
season, and you know what?

19
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,725
Come on.

20
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:17,246
I'm fucking excited.

21
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,318
Shower up, and lets go
and have a few beers.

22
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,600
- Think he's paying?

23
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,075
- Eating for two, babe?

24
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,145
- I don't want to become a
skinny bitch

25
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,698
like one of this lot.

26
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:56,630
Carbs!

27
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,634
- Ladies and Gentlemen.

28
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm going to jump straight
in and say a big thank you

29
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:05,881
to our hosts, the Rochester
boys, for the Rugby lesson,

30
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:07,365
and most generous hospitality.

31
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,884
It's much appreciated.

32
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:15,304
I promise we'll return
the favor at our place,

33
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,686
on both fronts, when the time
comes.

34
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,654
Now, for man of the match,
it was an easy choice

35
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,863
to set the tone for this season.

36
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:25,211
This man put in an incredibly
tenacious

37
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,419
and creative performance,

38
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,628
and he might even have won
it for us at the end there,

39
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,388
if he just looked inside.

40
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:31,907
No, but really, really great
work,

41
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,632
and I can see that you're going
to be

42
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,359
a big asset for us this season.

43
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:37,844
So, well done, Mark Newton.

44
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,750
And my first Dick Of The Day
award goes to the only man

45
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:50,891
I've ever known to tackle
one of his own players.

46
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,686
Fuck.

47
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,687
- Mr. Pink.

48
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,105
I hit my head

49
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:03,870
- He is a stag
lad, he is a stag lad,

50
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:08,185
he shouts it proudly,
night and day, hey, hey.

51
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:12,465
He's never lonely when we are
with him,

52
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:17,366
and he knows how to put a pint
away, pint away, pint away,

53
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,818
pint away, pint away,
pint away, pint away.

54
00:05:56,543 --> 00:06:00,685
- You didn't get
any pictures today? Mark.

55
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,619
- Oh, yeah, no, I wasn't really
in the mood after the game,

56
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,724
to be honest.

57
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:08,003
- Shame. That ref would
have made a nice picture.

58
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,350
- Oh, he was hot.

59
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,770
- Shall I book
us tickets for tomorrow?

60
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:19,221
What do you fancy seeing?

61
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,016
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,673
- Look, I can't. Ricky's coming
over.

63
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,675
- Cumming? It's been a while,
hasn't it?

64
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,987
Hasn't it healed over by
now? Isn't there cobwebs?

65
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,404
- Yeah, and spiders. I bet
there's spiders in there and
all.

66
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:36,825
- I don't know about
you,

67
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,861
but I would kill my
firstborn for a mojito.

68
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,069
- Firstborn what?

69
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:44,764
- Cocktails at the
clubhouse. You'll be lucky.

70
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:45,765
- Ugh

71
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,595
- Yeah, I'll buy you a pint.

72
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,265
Look, I agreed
to your little project

73
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,612
to train up new players to
eventually join

74
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,339
and benefit the A squad,

75
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,824
not to burn through our limited
funds

76
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:13,068
with a whole other separate
team,

77
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,035
and carting them off-
- Yeah, but just recruiting

78
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,693
experienced players isn't
going to put us on the map.

79
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,006
- We're already on the map.

80
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,871
The A's win almost all their
games.

81
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,499
For years, we fought tooth and
nail to get the recognition

82
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,400
and respect that we now
have as a serious club,

83
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,056
not some novelty act.

84
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:38,335
I won't go back to that.

85
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:41,027
- And having a B team
that loses a few games

86
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,408
isn't going to change anything.

87
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,755
They just need a bit of time.

88
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:48,793
It was their first game of the
season.

89
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,693
Please, Barry.

90
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:58,631
- Just be sure that you're
not letting your pride

91
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:01,289
drag our name through the dirt.

92
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,471
- Cunts. Like they own the
place.

93
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:13,749
- Deep breaths, Pinky.

94
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,374
- I'm from the As. Watch us
wave our big dicks about.

95
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,099
- Trust me, I've seen a few of
them,

96
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:21,757
and they're not all
worth writing home about.

97
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,000
- They're not all cunts, you
know.

98
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:27,453
- Oh yeah? Is that why you
dropped down to play with us?

99
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,937
- See, now there we go.

100
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,388
- Cheers, boys.

101
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:32,630
- So, they won then?

102
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:33,528
- Of course they did.

103
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:36,013
You can smell the smugness in
the air.

104
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,946
- Do they even like
each other?

105
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,706
No. Not really.

106
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,707
- What's the fucking point,
then?

107
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:42,916
- It's just a different
mentality, isn't it?

108
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:46,126
That's why they keep winning, I
guess.

109
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,801
- You are such a size queen.

110
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,665
- She doesn't even
care who it's attached to,

111
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,115
as it needs a whole tub of lube
to fit

112
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,186
into that tight little arse of
hers.

113
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,671
- Honey, at least I have an
arse, okay?

114
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:15,604
I don't even know what you
call that mound of sand

115
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,088
hanging off your back.

116
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:20,782
Now, you see that guy?

117
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:22,887
- What, the muscle daddy?

118
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:25,752
Saw him at the urinals earlier.

119
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:28,721
I checked out the goods.
The homework is done.

120
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:31,206
Now, I just have to hand in my
assignment,

121
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,519
if you know what I mean.

122
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,624
- I'm glad to see all those
years in English school paid up,

123
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,660
I really am.

124
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,180
- Watch it, mate.
- Sorry.

125
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:43,977
- Henry, Henry.

126
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,084
with me, alright?

127
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,469
Jesus.

128
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:54,194
Henry, how much have you had?

129
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:55,920
I, er...

130
00:09:58,509 --> 00:09:59,786
Shall I get you some water, or
something?

131
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,894
- No, just leave.
Please, go. Go.

132
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,878
- You're Mark Newton, right?

133
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,156
- Yeah, that's right.

134
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,745
- I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

135
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:02,746
- Who from?

136
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:06,888
- Man of the
match today. Not bad.

137
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:08,096
- That?

138
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,857
- No, well done. I'm Warren.

139
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,274
- Are you in the A squad?

140
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,828
I mean, I saw you at
the clubhouse earlier,

141
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:17,657
but I've not seen you round
before.

142
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:19,107
- Yeah, I've been out for
a while with an injury.

143
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:23,180
Fucked my leg, but I'm back
and fit to play again now.

144
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:24,284
- Clearly.

145
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,083
- Do you want a drink?

146
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:32,189
- Sure.

147
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:46,652
- Two shots of tequila.

148
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,620
You serious?

149
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,173
- Puts hairs on your chest.

150
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,762
- Oh, is that something I want,
is it?

151
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:54,936
- You tell me.

152
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:41,810
- I didn't realize you lot
spoke to us lowly mortals.

153
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,812
- We make exceptions for certain
people.

154
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,884
- Is that right? I'm honored.

155
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,610
- As you should be.

156
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:49,611
Yeah?

157
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:55,030
Well, you certainly live
up to the stereotype.

158
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,239
- Devilishly handsome?

159
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,069
- Full of yourselves.

160
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:02,590
- I'm hurt.

161
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:07,664
- Really? I didn't realize
you As bruised so easily.

162
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:10,736
That must make things
a bit impractical, no?

163
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,186
- Do you even get bruised in the
B team?

164
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:17,156
Doesn't that involve
taking some hits first?

165
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,642
- You're a piece of work, you
know that?

166
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:32,965
Enjoy the rest of your night.

167
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:41,974
Henry?

168
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:57,808
- Fuck.

169
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,727
- Everything all right?

170
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,524
- You shouldn't have brought me
here.

171
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,733
- Excuse me?

172
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,529
- Where's my wallet?

173
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:32,049
- Why are you in such a rush?

174
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,086
Hey.

175
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,778
- Bye.

176
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,055
- Oh, wow.

177
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,886
You really are living up to
the A-Squad-A-hole stereotype,

178
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,956
aren't you?

179
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,097
- I have a boyfriend.

180
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,894
- Well that might have been
useful information last night,

181
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:49,895
don't you think?

182
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,241
- You never asked.

183
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,932
- When was I supposed to
do that?

184
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,831
Before or after you
cornered me in a toilet

185
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:55,970
and stuck your tongue down my
throat?

186
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:57,419
- He's a Stag.

187
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,389
- Who?

188
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:03,011
- John Penrose. He's in
my team-

189
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,116
- Yeah, I know who he is.

190
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,014
- Yeah, well he
can't find out about this,

191
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,533
so don't fucking tell him
or anyone, you hear me?

192
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,915
- Relax, Jesus, I won't.

193
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:11,364
- I'm serious.

194
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,332
- Yeah, I can see that.

195
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,059
- Look, I don't mean to be-

196
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,268
- Just go, all right?

197
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:20,995
Go on.

198
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:39,245
- Hey.

199
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,143
- Hey.

200
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,526
You eaten?

201
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:45,700
- No, not really.

202
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,426
- You look rough.

203
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,084
- Thank you. I went out last
night.

204
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:52,638
- With your pretend rugby team?

205
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,330
- And how was your flight?

206
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,607
- Did you
bring one of them home?

207
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,574
- Richard, do we really
going to do this right now?

208
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:58,471
You've literally just walked in
the door.

209
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:00,232
- Well, you're going
to love

210
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,130
what I've got to say next.

211
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,994
I've got to go away again in two
days.

212
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:04,961
- You serious?

213
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:06,238
- For a month.
- A month?

214
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:07,135
Are you joking?

215
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,414
- Flight's booked on
Tuesday.

216
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:12,934
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:39,193
- Hey, where did
you end up Saturday night?

218
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:40,159
You disappeared.

219
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:43,197
- Just home. I tried looking for
you, but-

220
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,647
- It's fine. I
was just a bit smashed.

221
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:48,374
- I'll say.
That's one word for it.

222
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,031
What was his name again?

223
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:50,928
- What's this?

224
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:51,826
- You've got to hear
this.

225
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,690
- No, he doesn't,
actually.

226
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:54,656
- So this one
was stumbling about,

227
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:57,176
saying he was leaving, but
before he goes,

228
00:19:57,211 --> 00:20:00,076
he runs into the guy that
Neil's been making out with

229
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,111
all night.

230
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:02,423
- Oh Henry, no.

231
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:04,563
- Yeah. Sloppy seconds.

232
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,160
- Gareth really pisses me off.

233
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:18,853
- That's just him.
Nobody actually cares.

234
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:19,716
- I do.

235
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:22,581
- Okay.

236
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,586
Was this guy really that bad?

237
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,280
- No, mate. Worse.
It was not my finest moment.

238
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:06,245
- Jog back, jog back.

239
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:28,233
- Right, excellent.

240
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,682
Keep it low, guys.

241
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,548
Good, smash, good.

242
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,864
That's it, good hit.
That's it. Well done. Good.

243
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,831
Hit! Good hit. Good hit.

244
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:45,595
Try and keep driving through all
the way.

245
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,392
Good, excellent. Good hit.

246
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:52,498
Okay, it's your mother
in law. Give her a hit.

247
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,500
Good, good. That's it.

248
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:58,711
- A squad, over
with me, far pitch, please.

249
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:56,286
- Rich?

250
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:48,881
- Hey.

251
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:53,783
- I can stand here and smile
at you all night, if you like.

252
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:55,371
- Sorry, come in.

253
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:03,793
- Wow.

254
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,107
That's really something.

255
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,869
- Yeah. Yeah, it never gets old.

256
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:14,700
- How can you afford this place?

257
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:19,464
- Well, actually,
it's my partner Richard's.

258
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,845
What? You never asked either.

259
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,128
- You know, I think
I can see my place from here.

260
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:33,409
All the way down there, with
the other little people.

261
00:25:33,443 --> 00:25:35,480
- Do you want a drink?

262
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:39,415
- Actually. An attempt to redeem
myself.

263
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,521
Sorry about Sunday.

264
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:47,975
- Thanks. I wasn't really
expecting you to message me.

265
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:53,187
- I felt bad
about not doing it before.

266
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:57,191
I didn't really like how things
were left.

267
00:25:57,225 --> 00:26:00,884
- I have been thinking
about you, I suppose.

268
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:01,782
- Really?

269
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:06,649
I've barely thought about you at
all.

270
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:12,448
So, how long have you been
together?

271
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:13,932
- About 4 years.

272
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,831
- Okay. But you guys
are open?

273
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,730
- Yeah, obviously.

274
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,870
- I don't think John
would ever agree to that.

275
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:23,182
- So, you just do
it behind his back instead?

276
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:27,048
- Hey. That's never
happened before. I mean it.

277
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,050
- Okay, all right.
No need to get defensive.

278
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:29,948
- I'm not.

279
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:32,744
I'm really not.

280
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:34,849
- Okay. I'm only teasing.

281
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,479
- So, do you have rules
or something, then?

282
00:26:44,652 --> 00:26:48,484
- Actually, yeah. But
they're all Richard's ones.

283
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:50,796
- What? No sleeping with rugby
players?

284
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:54,110
- Surprisingly, that's
actually not one of them.

285
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:55,629
Although that is the only reason
he thinks

286
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:57,182
I joined the Stags.

287
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,735
- Well, is it?

288
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,633
- No.

289
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:04,500
- So, why did you, then?
Did you play at school?

290
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:07,848
- I bet you were very good at
school.

291
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:09,677
You were, weren't you?

292
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,576
Typical A team player.

293
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:14,648
- You guys really don't like us,
do you?

294
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:17,133
- Well you don't really help
yourselves.

295
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:21,068
Speaking of which, I saw
you and John at training.

296
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:23,035
- Oh. The happy couple?

297
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,106
- You tell me.

298
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:28,731
- So, what were those rules
again?

299
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:31,250
Of your open relationship.

300
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:32,148
- Okay.

301
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,912
So, no one we know.

302
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:42,227
I have to tell Rich about
anyone that I sleep with.

303
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,781
- and, um

304
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:47,715
- And?

305
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,996
- And no repeat visits.

306
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:54,101
- Is that so?

307
00:27:56,206 --> 00:28:00,935
So, I'm guessing Richard knows
I'm coming round tonight?

308
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:03,766
- Not exactly, no.

309
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,253
- But he knows about Saturday
night?

310
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:17,642
Breaking all the rules. We're
doing so well, aren't we?

311
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:18,539
- Shut up.

312
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,162
- So, I guess you could say

313
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:24,890
that we're not the perfect
couple either.

314
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:26,651
- Well, if I were him I'd kick
your arse

315
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:27,755
out of this fancy place.

316
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,620
- It's a good thing you're
not him, then, isn't it?

317
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:34,313
- Yeah, you wouldn't want
to get involved. I'm awful.

318
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:35,176
- Oh yeah?

319
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,180
- Yeah, definitely not.

320
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:41,217
- I should just stay clear.

321
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:43,115
- Probably best.

322
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,082
- Probably.

323
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,361
- You're going to be trouble.

324
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,710
- Drive through. Drive
it up.

325
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:27,056
Keep your back straight, guys.

326
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,231
- Ready, ready, ready,
go.

327
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,240
- Ready, ready, ready.

328
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:40,897
- Good,
remember, enter the tackle

329
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:43,728
with your leading leg, so
you control the contact.

330
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:44,591
Okay?

331
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,800
- Ready, ready, ready,
go.

332
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,905
- That's it.

333
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,320
- Good, good, good, good,
well done.

334
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,151
- Ready, ready, ready,
up!

335
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,188
- Easy, Pinky.

336
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:57,914
- All right, China doll.

337
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:01,262
- Ready, ready, ready,
go.

338
00:30:01,297 --> 00:30:03,092
Ready, ready, ready, go.

339
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:04,749
- A squad.

340
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:13,136
- I'm not going to lie, Pinky.

341
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:15,104
Watching Gareth bitch and
moan when you took him down,

342
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:17,693
it made me feel all kinds of
warm inside.

343
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:19,798
- It was good, wasn't it?

344
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,042
- Get off.

345
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:23,388
- All right, man. Calm down.

346
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,734
- Hello, John.

347
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,288
Warren, you're back?

348
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:28,289
- Yeah.

349
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:29,774
I've been given the all
clear to play again.

350
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,327
- So he says, anyway.

351
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,225
- Oh, John,
these are my teammates.

352
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,779
This is Pinky and Mark.

353
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:39,128
- Pinky, Mark? I'm John,
this is Warren, my partner.

354
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:42,476
- Nice to meet you, Mark. Pinky.

355
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,305
- Warren and I are
talking about going for some food,

356
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,755
you guys want to join?

357
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,618
- I'd love to.

358
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:47,757
- Oh, I've got to head
off.

359
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:49,414
Got work to do before bed.

360
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,278
- Yeah, no, I should probably
head off too, actually.

361
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:53,107
- Oh, come on, Mark.

362
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,144
He was just moaning that he was
starving.

363
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:56,766
Where were you thinking?

364
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,941
- Somewhere local.

365
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:00,425
- Somewhere local?

366
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,153
- Yeah, sure. Let's.

367
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,913
Yeah

368
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:10,193
- I know somewhere
lovely.

369
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:14,266
- It was the way she came
down and leered at us

370
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,372
as we came off the pitch.

371
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:19,893
- No, but at least
we had supporters, though.

372
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:21,135
- True.

373
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,103
- God, I miss being a
student.

374
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:25,899
- Well, you still
drink like you are.

375
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:27,245
Don't you want to settle down,

376
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,385
and have a nice man and a dog
someday?

377
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:32,008
- What, and end up like
this one?

378
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:33,769
- Henry.
- Oh fuck, I'm sorry.

379
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:36,012
All chained up and unhappy.

380
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:41,500
No, no, there is still far
too much exploring to do.

381
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:43,502
- Okay, Columbus. I think
that's enough, mate.

382
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:44,745
- What the fuck?

383
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,953
- It's true, man.

384
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,404
Your teeth have reached a
delightful shade of Merlot.

385
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:51,752
- Who the fuck are
you? The fucking tooth fairy?

386
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:55,825
- Well, it's a
pleasure to meet you, Mark.

387
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,276
It'd be nice to meet Richard
sometime.

388
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,866
- Now, speaking of the tooth
fairy.

389
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,074
You never see him.

390
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:05,766
But there's always money under
the pillow.

391
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,009
- Okay, bill please?

392
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:08,113
- Come on, come on.

393
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:11,116
Look, look, he doesn't
come to any of his games.

394
00:32:11,151 --> 00:32:13,291
None of them, but it's fine,
because,

395
00:32:13,325 --> 00:32:15,258
"We're in a long distance
relationship."

396
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,984
- Henry, that's
enough. That's enough.

397
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:17,882
- Okay.

398
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,955
He gets by with the
occasional fuck on the side

399
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:23,404
to keep him going-
- Enough.

400
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,302
Leave it.

401
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,409
- Henry, never change,
man.

402
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:39,144
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. You all right?

403
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,076
- Yeah.
- Stand up.

404
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:41,353
Come on. Right.

405
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:46,427
- all right?

406
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:48,395
- God, I wanted to die.

407
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:53,055
- Really? I thought it
was hot.

408
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:57,542
- What is wrong with you?
What about that was hot?

409
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,130
- Henry has a lot to say
for himself, doesn't he?

410
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:00,338
- What were you thinking,

411
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:02,581
inviting me out to dinner
with your fucking boyfriend?

412
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,549
- It's just another Stag,
and one of Henry's friends.

413
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,000
- I don't care. I don't care.

414
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:09,830
Christ, I was bursting out of my
skin.

415
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:14,352
- I was bursting out of my
pants. I still fucking am.

416
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:15,905
- You're unbelievable.

417
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,182
- Guys, man.

418
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:19,150
Are you both going to leave me
here with this human puddle?

419
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:21,290
- Yeah, I'll order a taxi now.

420
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:22,187
- Taxi.

421
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:24,880
- What are you doing
this week?

422
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:26,088
I want to take you out.

423
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:27,606
- Guys.

424
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:30,506
- I'm doing it. Are you fucking
serious?

425
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,887
- Taxi.

426
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,407
- Is that a yes?

427
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:38,514
- Yes, all right. Just shut up,
Okay?

428
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:45,624
- God.

429
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,491
Cried my eyes out during that.

430
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:53,356
- You're joking. It was so
boring.

431
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:55,703
I'm choosing the next one.

432
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:58,051
- How could you not cry
when his mother died?

433
00:33:58,085 --> 00:33:59,155
- I don't know.

434
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,502
Maybe because I'm not
tired and over-emotional?

435
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,509
- Who's that?

436
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,304
- It's nothing.

437
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,167
- Richard?

438
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:12,203
- What?

439
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:13,998
- Richard.

440
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:16,276
- Er, No. Um-

441
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,243
Look, I'm sorry, I've got to go.

442
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:19,106
- What?

443
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,176
- It's work. Something's come
up.

444
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:22,385
I've got to go deal with it.

445
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,352
- Oh, okay.

446
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:28,184
Right, Well, I guess
I'll see you at training.

447
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,290
- Yeah, yeah, definitely.

448
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:01,390
- You are late.

449
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:05,566
- You are early.

450
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:07,983
- Come on.

451
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:21,444
- You know, I haven't been to
the fair since I was a kid.

452
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:25,379
- Yes.

453
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:29,349
- No, I'm not going on
that.

454
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:32,386
No, I'm not going on that.

455
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,974
- Live a little. It'll be fun.

456
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:34,664
- No.

457
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:35,665
Hey!

458
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,460
No, wait, Warren, I...

459
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:39,686
- Let's go back to yours.

460
00:37:53,596 --> 00:37:54,459
- Okay?

461
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:56,806
- Yeah.

462
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,229
- Are you staying over?

463
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:08,266
- I can't. Sorry.

464
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,649
- No it's fine. I understand.

465
00:38:21,624 --> 00:38:23,695
Why do you stay with him?

466
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:26,388
- I could ask you the same
thing.

467
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:28,355
- Yeah, I know, I know.

468
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,633
But like,

469
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:33,774
- But like, why do you stay
together

470
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,881
when you know things aren't
right?

471
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,816
- Is this about you and
Richard or me and John?

472
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,923
- A bit of both, maybe?

473
00:38:46,718 --> 00:38:48,686
- Do we have to talk about this?

474
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,275
- No, no, of course not.

475
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:53,449
Forget I said anything.

476
00:38:56,832 --> 00:39:00,870
- Okay. Five years ago-
- Oh god, I'm getting

477
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,872
the full story aren't I?

478
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:03,735
- Shh!

479
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,428
- Five years ago-
- Look I take it back,

480
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:07,360
I take it back.

481
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:08,775
I wish I'd never asked, just
spare me.

482
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:09,707
- Listen.

483
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,574
I was in a bit of a bad place.

484
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:15,989
- Oh What? Croydon?

485
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:18,578
Sorry.

486
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:23,376
- John was good to me.

487
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:26,758
He introduced me to the
Stags, got me back into rugby.

488
00:39:26,793 --> 00:39:29,382
- Spare me the white knight
cliche.

489
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,453
- I'm sorry, Mr. "I live in my
boyfriend's

490
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:34,490
expensive penthouse."
- Oi.

491
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:38,460
- I'm just saying I think
it's a bit different.

492
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:43,775
- A bit?

493
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:48,332
- Well, maybe a few
similarities.

494
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:04,658
- Two seconds. Just
stay there. Don't move.

495
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,970
Just as you are.

496
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:17,257
- What is that?
- Just stay still.

497
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:28,717
10 seconds.

498
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,580
- Whoa.
- Don't smudge it.

499
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,859
- That's amazing.

500
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:09,344
- Thanks.

501
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,589
- One for your
collection?

502
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:15,419
- Yeah. Something like that.

503
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:18,042
Something to remember the day
by.

504
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,338
- Okay, guys, right.

505
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,029
Got a big game this weekend,
yeah?

506
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:44,413
Cardiff, away, on their home
turf.

507
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,035
I'm going to be putting
out the team list tomorrow,

508
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,624
so you can sort out your
travel arrangements.

509
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:49,970
If you've got any problems with
that,

510
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,972
come and talk to the captain.

511
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:55,459
Now, I've got a good pool of
players I can choose from.

512
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm going to choose the
strongest team possible.

513
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,567
- and I make no apologies to
any of you aren't on that team.

514
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:01,741
All right?

515
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,881
But if you got an issue about
it,

516
00:42:03,915 --> 00:42:05,745
you can come and speak to me,

517
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:08,092
and if you want to chat
about improving your game,

518
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,093
you can do that as well.

519
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:13,718
But as ever, my decision
is final. All right?

520
00:42:13,753 --> 00:42:17,032
And it goes without saying
that if you're not chosen,

521
00:42:17,066 --> 00:42:19,137
you can come along and
support your teammates,

522
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:22,037
and I hope that many of
you will, I really do.

523
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:23,176
Good, let's go.

524
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,051
- Don't worry
about it. You'll be fine.

525
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:40,918
- You'll be fine.
There's no one as fat as you.

526
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:44,024
Fingers crossed for you though,
love.

527
00:43:01,732 --> 00:43:05,943
- Oh, Mark. I'll book us
a hotel room for Cardiff.

528
00:43:05,977 --> 00:43:09,015
- Yeah, yeah. What about you,
Pink?

529
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:12,018
- I'll crash with Carlos,
if he's selected, anyway.

530
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:12,915
Says he won't go otherwise as,

531
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,986
"Cardiff is too far and too shit
to go

532
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:16,816
just for a night out."

533
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,059
- What? You're playing the
Draconians?

534
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:20,716
- Yeah.

535
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:23,995
- Good luck. They even
gave us a run for our money.

536
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,480
- Great.

537
00:43:25,514 --> 00:43:26,895
- Stuart must be
splashing out,

538
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:30,761
because Barry hasn't
sent us there for years.

539
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:40,702
- Northern line:
the train now approaching

540
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:42,151
is to...

541
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,785
- You go on up ahead. I'll hang
back.

542
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,890
- Yeah, sure.

543
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,252
- Boys, selection's up.

544
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:49,356
- Ooh, yes.

545
00:44:49,391 --> 00:44:52,152
- What? Give me a sec.
Okay, South London Stags.

546
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:54,258
B team Cardiff away game.

547
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,742
Okay, here we go.

548
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:59,574
Pinky, Jimmy, Gareth, Vlad,
Bjorn.

549
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:00,747
- He's not been
at training in weeks.

550
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,300
- He still put himself down as
available.

551
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,890
- Dean, Peter H,
Frankie, me, scrum half.

552
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:07,892
Thank you very much, Stu. Tom at
10-

553
00:45:07,927 --> 00:45:09,549
- Thank God. Someone decent
to catch your shitty throws-

554
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:11,171
- Mark and Henry in the centers.

555
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:13,967
Carlos and Liam on the
wings, and Ian at 15.

556
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:18,800
Subs on the bench, York, Ford
and Warren Hunt. What? Who?

557
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:21,319
- - Jimmy] Wait, is that
right? Let me see that.

558
00:45:21,354 --> 00:45:23,943
- Oh shit, Bad luck Oli.

559
00:45:23,977 --> 00:45:27,325
- No, it's fine. Maybe
I'll still come watch.

560
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,327
- Not sure why you look
so happy.

561
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:32,745
Stuart isn't going to leave
an A team player on the bench.

562
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:34,816
He'll be in the starting lineup.

563
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,127
- He's a prop, isn't he?

564
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:40,649
- Oh Fuck, yeah. He is. Well,
that's one of us out then, G.

565
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:41,823
- He just wants to
give him a run out on the pitch

566
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:42,927
at some point.

567
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:44,204
I'm not worried.

568
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:45,481
- He said he was going
to field the strongest team.

569
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:48,001
- Clearly not, because
he selected you, didn't he?

570
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,038
- Fuck you.
- I bet you would.

571
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:51,764
But even I have standards.

572
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:53,800
- Hey, hey.
- Whoa.

573
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,284
- Let's grab a drink.

574
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,320
- Not tonight.

575
00:45:56,354 --> 00:46:00,151
- Turning down
a drink? That's a first.

576
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:14,200
- Are you insane? What were you
thinking?

577
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:15,995
- Relax. Look, I just spoke
to Stuart and I told him that-

578
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:19,101
- You spoke to Stuart?
And said what exactly?

579
00:46:19,136 --> 00:46:20,413
- I just told him I fancied an
easy game

580
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:22,001
to get back into things after
injury,

581
00:46:22,035 --> 00:46:23,347
and also wouldn't mind a good
night out.

582
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,867
- An easy game? Yeah?

583
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:27,075
What, and you don't think
people might find that

584
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:28,352
a little suspicious?

585
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,216
That an A team player
just decided to randomly

586
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,046
come and play with us for a
game?

587
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:35,393
What did John say?

588
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,329
Have you even spoken to him?

589
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,745
Christ, Warren.

590
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:44,989
I can't believe you've fucking
done this.

591
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:47,129
- You're over-reacting.

592
00:46:47,164 --> 00:46:48,337
It'll be fun. We'll get to play
together.

593
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,409
- Did you even think to ask
if I'd be okay with this?

594
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:52,790
No, you didn't.

595
00:46:53,998 --> 00:46:56,276
- I've booked us a hotel room.

596
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:03,387
- A hotel room? That's
wonderful. Really, really.

597
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:07,011
That's wonderful. That's the
best one yet.

598
00:47:15,882 --> 00:47:18,816
Probably shouldn't arrive
together.

599
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:36,489
- for the 8:18
Great Western Railway Service

600
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:39,319
to Cardiff Central...

601
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:44,048
- - Jimmy] Right, they're going
by car.

602
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,774
Ah, hello.

603
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:46,982
- Hola.

604
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:48,501
- - Jimmy] One train ticket for
you sir.

605
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:49,882
- Thanks.

606
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:53,368
Right. Is that everyone?

607
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:55,025
- Er, Pinky's not here
yet.

608
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:58,373
- - Jimmy] Of course he's not.
He's got about five minutes.

609
00:47:58,407 --> 00:47:59,823
Better hurry up.

610
00:48:01,376 --> 00:48:04,379
Ah, finally.

611
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:06,519
- Dick of the day
already, Pinky.

612
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,314
- No, it was dick last night.

613
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:12,102
- Right guys,
it's shitty weather.

614
00:49:12,136 --> 00:49:15,312
Get out there quickly, warm
up, kick off in 30 minutes.

615
00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:18,833
Vlad, get yourself strapped
up. You're jumping.

616
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:22,353
- Fuck, I'm actually quite
nervous.

617
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:25,218
- You'll be fine. Just think
of it like any other game.

618
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,289
- Right, I want you to
start

619
00:49:27,324 --> 00:49:29,982
your pre-match mental rituals.

620
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:34,469
Visualize those first
tackles. Those first hits.

621
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:36,229
How are they going to feel?

622
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,231
I want you to get in the right
head-space.

623
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,199
Channel that aggression.

624
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:44,582
Get rid of all that mental
baggage, and just focus.

625
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:56,042
Okay, Pinky, you're
going to be loose-head.

626
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,424
Jimmy, you're going to be
hooker. Warren, tight-head.

627
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:59,632
Sorry G, but I need a lot of
experience

628
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,013
against this team today.

629
00:50:01,047 --> 00:50:02,186
I'll bring you on for the second
half.

630
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:04,982
In the engine room, we've
got Vlad, Bjorn, Flankers,

631
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:06,846
we've got Pete and Dean,
and number eight, Felix.

632
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:09,504
Neil, you're going to be
number nine, Tommy, 10,

633
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:11,230
and then the centers,
we've got Mark, Henry.

634
00:50:11,264 --> 00:50:12,852
Mark, I want you to play
outside center today.

635
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:13,749
Let's see how that goes.

636
00:50:13,784 --> 00:50:15,613
On the wings, we've got Liam and
Carlos.

637
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:16,787
Fullback, we've got Yorkie.

638
00:50:16,822 --> 00:50:18,927
Ian, I'll bring you on for
Yorkie in the second half.

639
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:20,308
Just keep yourself warm and
ready.

640
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:21,412
- Two minutes, gents.

641
00:50:21,447 --> 00:50:22,137
- Thank you, sir.

642
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:23,173
- Right, captain. What you got?

643
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:25,313
- I've got aggression,
yeah? We've got hunger.

644
00:50:25,347 --> 00:50:26,590
And I've got your backs.

645
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:29,179
I need you to have mine
and each other's, yeah?

646
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:31,008
Now, I didn't come all the way
to Wales

647
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:32,147
in this shitty fucking weather

648
00:50:32,182 --> 00:50:35,426
to see us lot give anything
less than 100%, okay?

649
00:50:35,461 --> 00:50:37,566
Yeah, no mercy. Come on, yes.

650
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:40,328
Three, two, one.

651
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:42,295
- Stags!

652
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:16,355
- Okay, guys, really
well done, really well done,

653
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:17,666
but we're not there yet.

654
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:18,633
I was going to make a few
changes,

655
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:20,497
but I'm going to keep the lineup
as it is.

656
00:52:20,531 --> 00:52:22,499
Pinky, one, fantastic teamwork.

657
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:24,225
Mark, brilliant try.

658
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:26,572
Let's get back up there
and do the business.

659
00:53:30,222 --> 00:53:33,846
- Lads, lads. A little something
to toast our first victory.

660
00:54:32,284 --> 00:54:35,356
- - Jimmy] Gentlemen? Thank you.

661
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,357
That was a tough game,

662
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:37,496
and I think I'm going to be
walking funny

663
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,325
for a few days after that.

664
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,535
Thank you, Cardiff, for
hosting us so generously,

665
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,468
and for giving us such a
good run for our money.

666
00:54:44,503 --> 00:54:45,642
So thank you.

667
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:51,544
- And for our man of the match
this week,

668
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,718
I think it's got to go to
someone

669
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:54,582
who really turned the game
around for us.

670
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:56,170
The kind of performance that I
think

671
00:54:56,204 --> 00:54:57,895
we should all aspire to.

672
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,761
And it's been a few years,
but I for one really enjoyed

673
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:03,660
having him back in amongst us.

674
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:04,661
And I know that, strictly
speaking,

675
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:05,834
he's not one of our number,

676
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,285
but I can't think of anyone more
deserving

677
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,735
than Mr. Warren Hunt.

678
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:20,159
And a bit of housekeeping before
we go on.

679
00:55:20,194 --> 00:55:21,885
When we talk about aggression...

680
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,749
- Warren Hunt.

681
00:55:23,783 --> 00:55:28,271
He sounds like he's from
a long line of hunts.

682
00:55:28,305 --> 00:55:30,411
- - Jimmy] Vlad the Impaler
for starting a fight

683
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:31,791
on our opponents.

684
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:38,660
- He is a stag lad, he is a stag
lad,

685
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:11,866
- Oh it's such a
beautiful sight.

686
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,763
- Shut up.

687
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,560
- What the fuck's wrong with
you?

688
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:20,909
- It's a joke, Jimmy giving
him fucking man of the match.

689
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,635
If he loves his old teammates so
much,

690
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,912
he can fuck off back to them.

691
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:28,848
- Come on. Like we won, okay?
Just enjoy the night, yeah?

692
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:30,471
We were lucky to have him,
anyway.

693
00:56:30,505 --> 00:56:33,025
- Lucky? Do you want to
fuck him or something?

694
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:34,302
- Come off it, chica.

695
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:35,786
- No, Pinky, I'm
serious.

696
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:37,443
What's the point in us coming
all this way

697
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:40,239
just to have an A team Asshole
swoop in for the glory?

698
00:56:40,274 --> 00:56:42,690
While some of us sit on the
sidelines.

699
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:44,312
- I know, it's brilliant.

700
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:46,038
- Henry, if you hate
your team mates so much-

701
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:48,972
- Just the one. One.

702
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:51,699
I like you.

703
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,495
- Grow up.

704
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:01,605
- Okay. Drink, anyone?

705
00:57:04,677 --> 00:57:05,368
- I don't think I'll be winning

706
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:07,439
any popularity contests tonight.

707
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:11,788
- Since when has that bothered
you? They'll get over it.

708
00:57:11,822 --> 00:57:14,411
They're just wired a bit
differently, that's all.

709
00:57:14,446 --> 00:57:19,485
- Clearly. We were over the
moon after our first win.

710
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,418
- They're not that bothered
about it,

711
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:24,835
unlike our dear old
chairman, unfortunately.

712
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,630
- You want me to speak with him?

713
00:57:26,665 --> 00:57:28,425
- Not going to make much
difference.

714
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,395
Today will just give us
a bit longer, that's all.

715
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:36,433
Anyway, you've got bigger
things to worry about.

716
00:57:58,973 --> 00:58:01,424
- What are you doing? Henry?

717
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:03,702
- I miss you.

718
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:04,599
- I see you all the time, you
idiot-

719
00:58:04,634 --> 00:58:07,947
- You're always off, now. Doing
things.

720
00:58:10,502 --> 00:58:14,782
You don't love me anymore.
- Don't be stupid.

721
00:58:14,816 --> 00:58:16,093
What is this?

722
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:17,992
- Oh look, it's anywhere else
but here!

723
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:21,961
- Pink, can you just hold
this for a second? Please?

724
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:23,066
- Oh no, no, you don't.

725
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,861
- No, come on, come on.

726
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,414
- I hate you.

727
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:29,452
- Thank you. I'll be
outside.

728
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:55,710
- You've no idea how much
I've wanted to do that today.
- 你不知道
我今天有多想这样做。

729
00:59:55,745 --> 00:59:56,642
- Yeah?

730
00:59:57,505 --> 01:00:00,439
You could do it again if you
like.

731
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:36,751
- I really loved
playing with you today.

732
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:39,029
I'm glad you came.

733
01:00:39,064 --> 01:00:39,927
- Me too.

734
01:01:54,898 --> 01:01:55,830
- Oh, fuck.

735
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,669
Fuck

736
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,890
Morning, sleeping beauty.

737
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,927
You're going to get it.

738
01:02:33,868 --> 01:02:35,801
- Oh my God, he lives.

739
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:37,078
- Don't.

740
01:02:37,113 --> 01:02:40,703
- You have no idea the night
that we've had with this one.

741
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:41,635
Where were you, man?

742
01:02:41,669 --> 01:02:42,670
- Fuck, guys, I'm sorry.

743
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:44,292
I was knackered and I
guess I just sort of-

744
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:46,018
- You must have
slept like the fucking dead,

745
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,089
because we were hammering
on your door for an hour.

746
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:50,160
- Cinderella here lost her room
card.

747
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:51,058
- Who'd you pull?

748
01:02:51,092 --> 01:02:53,854
- What? Henry, seriously?
Come on.

749
01:02:53,888 --> 01:02:55,027
- How did you not hear us?

750
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,202
He had to sleep on our floor,
after we rinsed him off,

751
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:59,100
fully clothed in the shower.

752
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:02,310
- Do you like vomit?
No?

753
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,622
Neither do we.

754
01:03:03,657 --> 01:03:04,519
- I'm right here.

755
01:03:04,554 --> 01:03:06,383
- Oh my God, Henry. Not one more
word.

756
01:03:06,418 --> 01:03:10,318
- Wow. Ever the walking
advert for contraception.

757
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,699
- Leave off, will you?

758
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:13,149
- I don't blame you,
Mark.

759
01:03:13,183 --> 01:03:15,634
I wouldn't share a room with
that either.

760
01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:18,154
Clearly, boys, he found
somewhere better to stay.

761
01:03:18,188 --> 01:03:19,051
- He better not have.

762
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,846
- Look, I'm sorry, all
right?

763
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,193
I went to bed, and must have
passed out.

764
01:03:23,228 --> 01:03:24,678
And since when is it my
responsibility

765
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:26,300
to look after him, anyway?

766
01:03:26,334 --> 01:03:28,336
He's an adult, isn't he?

767
01:03:29,337 --> 01:03:30,787
- If you say so.

768
01:04:31,399 --> 01:04:32,331
- Hello.

769
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:34,023
- Jesus.

770
01:04:34,057 --> 01:04:35,369
You bastard, I almost died.

771
01:04:35,403 --> 01:04:38,096
- Nice to see you, too.

772
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,373
- Thought you weren't
back until next week.

773
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:40,305
- We finished early,

774
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:42,307
so they transferred my flight.

775
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:44,723
Do you mind if we head out?
I'm absolutely starving.

776
01:04:44,758 --> 01:04:47,415
- Really? Do we have to? I'm
shattered.

777
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,729
- How was your football
match? Did you win?

778
01:04:50,764 --> 01:04:52,006
- I told you already.

779
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:55,182
- Did you? Well were
you 'Man of the Moment'?

780
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,151
- Look, can we just get a
takeaway or something, instead?

781
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,741
- Yeah, fine. Here, chuck me
that kit.

782
01:05:02,776 --> 01:05:04,916
I'll throw it in the wash.

783
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:19,758
Who's Warren Hunt?

784
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,419
- Just a teammate. Why?

785
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:27,179
- You've got his shirt in your
bag.

786
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:30,355
Shall I chuck it in with the
rest?

787
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:34,980
- Yeah. Sure, thanks. I'll
give it to him at training.

788
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:09,316
- Hey mate.

789
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:10,558
Congratulations on the game
Saturday.

790
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:12,146
- Yeah, it was great.

791
01:07:12,181 --> 01:07:14,666
I didn't get to play
though, but no big deal.

792
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,323
- Henry.

793
01:07:16,357 --> 01:07:17,634
- That's a shame.
- Henry.

794
01:07:17,669 --> 01:07:19,533
- Mark. You off, love?

795
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:23,606
- Yeah. Other half's over, so we
just...

796
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,609
- And you still
came to training? Good man.

797
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:30,544
- Good man, indeed. Hope you
have a lovely evening together.

798
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:32,235
Doing anything nice?

799
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,651
- No, not really,
just a quiet night in.

800
01:07:34,686 --> 01:07:38,414
- Lovely. Enjoy your
evening.

801
01:07:38,448 --> 01:07:39,311
- Thanks.

802
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:44,454
See you.

803
01:07:44,489 --> 01:07:45,317
- See you.

804
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,388
- See you later, mate.

805
01:08:01,955 --> 01:08:04,578
- While I remember, have
you decided about Christmas?

806
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:05,544
- Rich, we've talked about this.

807
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:06,511
I've already booked flights.

808
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,064
- Yeah, I know.

809
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:09,100
I just thought it would be nice

810
01:08:09,134 --> 01:08:13,035
if we could spend some
time in the UK together.

811
01:08:13,069 --> 01:08:15,727
- You could always come with me.

812
01:08:15,761 --> 01:08:16,624
- I can't ski.

813
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,419
- You're not that bad,
Rich.

814
01:08:18,454 --> 01:08:20,663
- That is not what your dad
said.

815
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:22,216
- So that's a no, then, is it?

816
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:23,942
- I never get to spend
any time with my family-

817
01:08:23,977 --> 01:08:26,289
- Yeah, and neither do I.
- Then it's settled.

818
01:08:26,324 --> 01:08:30,984
There's not much point
discussing it further, is there?

819
01:08:35,264 --> 01:08:36,679
- Try again.

820
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:41,166
- Yeah loop, and loop, and loop!

821
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,306
Henry!

822
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:44,204
What's that?

823
01:08:45,136 --> 01:08:47,379
- Next line, ready?

824
01:08:49,623 --> 01:08:50,624
- Yes.

825
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,523
- Come on, Henry.

826
01:08:53,558 --> 01:08:55,180
- Next line.

827
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,183
- Yeah.

828
01:09:09,574 --> 01:09:14,372
- Okay, guys, that's
it. Time to go in. Come on.

829
01:09:20,067 --> 01:09:21,379
- What was that?

830
01:09:22,345 --> 01:09:23,174
Hey.

831
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:26,108
Everything all right?

832
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:28,351
- Why wouldn't it be?

833
01:09:28,386 --> 01:09:29,249
- Well, obviously it's not.

834
01:09:29,283 --> 01:09:31,354
You've barely spoken to me all
week.

835
01:09:31,389 --> 01:09:33,563
- Well, you are an adult, Mark,

836
01:09:33,598 --> 01:09:35,289
so I'm sure you'll survive.

837
01:09:35,324 --> 01:09:38,396
- Oh, come on. Look, fine
I'm sorry, but seriously-

838
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,572
Because you've been a shitty
friend for the last few months.

839
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:44,436
I mean, you never want to hang
out.

840
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:48,613
You don't want to do anything
outside of training, so -

841
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:52,755
Mate, Cardiff, that was
just the tipping point.

842
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,757
As I was really looking forward
to finally

843
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,414
spending some time together.

844
01:09:56,448 --> 01:09:58,830
- Well, I thought we did.

845
01:09:58,864 --> 01:10:00,176
That is, until you got smashed

846
01:10:00,211 --> 01:10:01,591
out of your fucking mind, as
usual.

847
01:10:01,626 --> 01:10:03,145
- Who the fuck are you? Gareth?

848
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,422
- What's the problem?
- Give me a fucking break.

849
01:10:04,456 --> 01:10:06,424
- What is the problem, then?

850
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:07,804
I didn't babysit you and rub
your back

851
01:10:07,839 --> 01:10:09,427
while you were throwing
up on some street corner?

852
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:10,738
- Fuck you, Mark.

853
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:14,052
- Look, I'm sorry I'm not the
shining example of friendship

854
01:10:14,087 --> 01:10:17,366
that you clearly expect me to
be.

855
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,334
Have you any idea what's
going on in my life?

856
01:10:20,369 --> 01:10:21,818
More to the point, have you even
asked?

857
01:10:21,853 --> 01:10:24,545
- Okay, then. Tell me, tell me.

858
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,513
What kind of actual problems do
you think

859
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:28,860
you have in your life, Mark?

860
01:10:28,894 --> 01:10:29,757
Hmm?

861
01:10:31,345 --> 01:10:33,278
- You know what, Henry?

862
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:37,144
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

863
01:10:37,179 --> 01:10:38,628
Just forget it.

864
01:10:38,663 --> 01:10:39,698
- No problem.

865
01:11:31,164 --> 01:11:32,855
- This is driving me fucking
crazy. When's Richard leaving?

866
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:33,752
- I don't know, Okay?

867
01:11:33,787 --> 01:11:37,204
- What do you mean, you don't
know?

868
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:38,792
- End of the week, maybe?

869
01:11:38,826 --> 01:11:39,689
I think.

870
01:11:41,657 --> 01:11:45,178
Stop it, Warren. This is fucking
insane.

871
01:11:45,212 --> 01:11:45,868
Warren.

872
01:12:55,731 --> 01:12:59,804
- That was a little
harsh. I do feel bad about it.

873
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:01,978
- Don't be.
He's a petulant child.

874
01:13:02,013 --> 01:13:04,326
I don't know why you care.

875
01:13:08,537 --> 01:13:09,917
He'll get over it.

876
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:16,890
- Last night was really
difficult for me.

877
01:13:16,924 --> 01:13:19,720
- How do you think I feel?
Knowing you were with him.

878
01:13:19,755 --> 01:13:21,481
- You go back to John every
night.

879
01:13:21,515 --> 01:13:22,482
- It's not the same.

880
01:13:22,516 --> 01:13:23,621
- You think I
like having to hide this

881
01:13:23,655 --> 01:13:24,587
from everyone we know,

882
01:13:24,622 --> 01:13:25,968
while I watch you parade around
with him?

883
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:27,590
- I hate you being with him.

884
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:30,938
- Well, now you know how
it feels.

885
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:35,702
If you want to change
that, you know what to do.

886
01:13:35,736 --> 01:13:37,669
- Oh, because that's so
simple?

887
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:39,430
- Well, it's
not impossible, Warren.

888
01:13:39,464 --> 01:13:41,259
- Do you have any idea the
drama that would cause?

889
01:13:41,294 --> 01:13:43,744
- Oh what, and you care
about that, do you?

890
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:47,852
- You're so naive sometimes-
- And you're a cunt.

891
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,517
- I'm sorry.

892
01:14:01,106 --> 01:14:02,418
It's just -

893
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:06,319
- It's just a bit overwhelming.

894
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:15,776
- Anyway.

895
01:14:18,503 --> 01:14:19,987
So, I was thinking.

896
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:25,338
Are you still on your
own over the holidays?

897
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:27,926
- Well.

898
01:14:29,134 --> 01:14:33,035
Me and John's family don't
exactly get on.

899
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:35,831
- Okay.

900
01:14:37,798 --> 01:14:41,733
So, come with me, to my parent's
place.

901
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:46,911
- Are you serious?

902
01:14:48,464 --> 01:14:49,810
- Is that a yes?

903
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:11,936
- Yeah I know. You too.

904
01:15:16,009 --> 01:15:17,838
- Does he suspect anything?

905
01:15:17,873 --> 01:15:20,047
- Not a thing. And what's to
suspect?

906
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,118
I'm going to Geneva to see my
friends.

907
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:24,051
- So, are you ready?

908
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,881
- Yeah, got my passport.

909
01:15:25,915 --> 01:15:29,022
- No, I mean to meet my parents.

910
01:15:29,056 --> 01:15:31,473
- Why? Should I be worried?

911
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:33,785
I bet your mum's fierce.

912
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:34,924
- Oh she is.

913
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,099
So fierce.

914
01:15:38,203 --> 01:15:39,757
- Oh God, she is.

915
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:45,487
- Yeah. You'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.

916
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:47,834
- She is, isn't she?

917
01:15:47,868 --> 01:15:48,731
Mark.

918
01:15:50,077 --> 01:15:50,940
Mark.

919
01:16:21,246 --> 01:16:23,145
- Hello.
- Hello, Mark.

920
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:24,042
- How you doing?

921
01:16:24,077 --> 01:16:25,630
- - Alice] How was your flight?
Come in!

922
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:29,082
- Yeah, no, we survived, just
about.

923
01:16:29,116 --> 01:16:32,119
- And you must be Warren.

924
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,776
Leonard.
- Pleasure.

925
01:16:33,811 --> 01:16:37,055
- - Alice] It's lovely to meet
you, Warren.

926
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,714
I'm Alice. You boys look
thirsty.

927
01:16:40,749 --> 01:16:42,544
I'll get you a drink.

928
01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:51,035
So, Mark tells me you're quite
the player.

929
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:54,141
- He's in the A squad,
Mom.

930
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,626
- - Alice] I bet.

931
01:16:56,523 --> 01:16:57,904
- - Len] Do you ski, Warren?

932
01:16:57,938 --> 01:17:00,700
- I do, yes. Well, I
have.

933
01:17:00,734 --> 01:17:02,115
I went a couple of times
when I was younger.

934
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:03,910
- - Alice] Dad will take
you both out tomorrow.

935
01:17:03,944 --> 01:17:06,706
You can borrow one of
our suits if you like.

936
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:09,847
You look like you'll fill it out
well.

937
01:17:34,665 --> 01:17:36,701
- It's a bit on the snug side.

938
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:40,705
- Let's have a look. Oh
yeah. I can see that.

939
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:56,859
- How do I look?

940
01:17:58,205 --> 01:17:59,068
- Tight.

941
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,685
- You OK?
- Yeah.

942
01:18:32,757 --> 01:18:35,104
I think I might have
overestimated my ability.

943
01:18:35,139 --> 01:18:37,279
- You'll be fine. Come on.

944
01:18:39,143 --> 01:18:41,732
Well look at that. Finally a
sport I can-

945
01:18:41,766 --> 01:18:43,112
- Don't even say it.

946
01:18:45,977 --> 01:18:47,807
- Off we go.

947
01:18:59,646 --> 01:19:01,821
- My God, you must be freezing.

948
01:19:01,855 --> 01:19:04,064
- I grew up here, didn't I?

949
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:16,836
- Thank you.

950
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:18,734
- What for?

951
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:20,874
- All of this.

952
01:19:26,777 --> 01:19:28,054
Your mother is, um -

953
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:30,746
- interesting.

954
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:33,266
- Yeah, she's a bit eccentric.

955
01:19:34,888 --> 01:19:36,821
- You're so lucky.

956
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:46,762
- You know, you weren't
actually that bad today.

957
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:48,246
- Everything hurts.

958
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:51,008
- I didn't realize you
A's bruise so easily.

959
01:20:00,017 --> 01:20:04,366
- You know, I'm pretty sure
that they've gone to bed.

960
01:23:20,113 --> 01:23:22,391
- I won't tell if you won't.

961
01:23:23,358 --> 01:23:26,602
- And when did you start smoking
again?

962
01:23:26,637 --> 01:23:30,606
- I wasn't talking about the
cigarette.

963
01:23:32,332 --> 01:23:36,129
It's so wonderful to have
you out here, darling.

964
01:23:36,164 --> 01:23:38,891
And of course, Warren is lovely.

965
01:23:39,961 --> 01:23:40,824
- Yeah.

966
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:48,383
Am I doing the right thing,
though?

967
01:23:50,557 --> 01:23:52,628
- When I met your father,

968
01:23:52,663 --> 01:23:56,184
I could barely take my eyes off
him, too.

969
01:23:57,564 --> 01:24:00,015
He wasn't available either.

970
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:00,982
- What?

971
01:24:01,016 --> 01:24:02,569
- I was no angel.

972
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:06,056
At the time, I was sleeping
with my history professor,

973
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:09,128
but we both knew that was just
sex.

974
01:24:09,162 --> 01:24:12,648
But what sex it was.
- Mum. Please.

975
01:24:12,683 --> 01:24:15,617
- Your father, however, was with
Jennifer.

976
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,481
Huge tits, like you've never
seen.

977
01:24:18,723 --> 01:24:22,624
The point I'm trying to make
is that they were in love.

978
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:25,385
High school sweethearts.

979
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:29,527
So, naturally, he couldn't
keep his hands off me.

980
01:24:30,459 --> 01:24:33,428
We went about the campus
hiding in shadows,

981
01:24:33,462 --> 01:24:37,535
sneaking into one another's
bedrooms, for months.

982
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,572
I put up with living in
Jennifer's shadow,

983
01:24:39,606 --> 01:24:43,887
because I knew I could
eventually steal his heart.

984
01:24:47,338 --> 01:24:50,272
Jennifer was heartbroken.

985
01:24:51,964 --> 01:24:55,415
After he ended it, she sent me a
letter.

986
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:58,625
It was one of the most
distressing things I've ever read.

987
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,181
I still have it. Your father has
no idea.

988
01:25:04,045 --> 01:25:08,187
We got married not long
after, and then we had you,

989
01:25:08,221 --> 01:25:11,535
my favorite human being on this
earth.

990
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:17,299
But darling, your Father
has never changed.

991
01:25:17,334 --> 01:25:21,062
The whole town knew about
Natalie.

992
01:25:21,096 --> 01:25:24,410
- My Au Pair?
Christ, Mom. I was five.

993
01:25:24,444 --> 01:25:26,412
- - Alice] And the years of
stolen moments

994
01:25:28,172 --> 01:25:30,554
That's just the two I know
about.

995
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:31,865
- Mum, this is a whole lot to
take in.

996
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,455
- - Alice] I've learnt to live
with your father's infidelity.

997
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:38,286
Every year, we get a little
older,

998
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,289
but it doesn't get any easier.

999
01:25:41,323 --> 01:25:44,050
Oh, he loves me, and I love him,

1000
01:25:45,534 --> 01:25:47,157
but I understand something now

1001
01:25:47,191 --> 01:25:52,196
that I didn't all those years
ago, from Jennifer's letter.

1002
01:25:52,507 --> 01:25:55,648
I understand not only
the collateral damage

1003
01:25:55,682 --> 01:25:57,788
an affair causes,

1004
01:25:57,822 --> 01:26:02,551
but how a relationship born from
deception

1005
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:06,107
only continues to create more.

1006
01:26:10,352 --> 01:26:11,560
Get some sleep.

1007
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:13,691
- He's getting better.

1008
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,801
- I really like him.

1009
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:22,217
- Whatever makes you happy.

1010
01:27:25,772 --> 01:27:28,085
- Dad, I wanted to ask you
something.

1011
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:28,775
- Yeah?

1012
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:37,474
- Me and Mom, we talked
about Jennifer last night.

1013
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:39,717
- One too many rosés, then.

1014
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:42,306
- Yeah, I guess.

1015
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:49,210
I don't know, it's just-
- Mark, I love your mother.

1016
01:27:49,244 --> 01:27:54,249
I don't know why she wants to
dig up this ancient history.

1017
01:27:54,663 --> 01:27:58,115
Warren seems like a good man.

1018
01:27:59,703 --> 01:28:03,155
His tits aren't as nice as
Jennifer's though I have to say.

1019
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:07,676
Listen.

1020
01:28:09,713 --> 01:28:12,371
Life comes at you fast.

1021
01:28:12,405 --> 01:28:16,375
Sometimes, it's hard
to find the joy in it,

1022
01:28:16,409 --> 01:28:20,724
so you just need to grab
hold of it whenever you can.

1023
01:28:25,763 --> 01:28:30,527
- I guess it's just hard to
know what's the right thing.

1024
01:28:31,459 --> 01:28:33,219
Without hurting anyone.

1025
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:34,945
- If you're always worried
about hurting someone,

1026
01:28:34,979 --> 01:28:36,084
you're going to miss out on some

1027
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:40,433
of the most incredible stuff
that life has to offer.

1028
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:45,473
WA-Hey.

1029
01:28:46,957 --> 01:28:48,648
Getting better.

1030
01:28:48,683 --> 01:28:49,718
- Yeah.

1031
01:29:28,516 --> 01:29:29,482
Ready?

1032
01:29:29,517 --> 01:29:30,380
- Yeah.

1033
01:31:30,154 --> 01:31:32,053
- Happy new year!

1034
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:33,813
- Not quite, love.

1035
01:31:33,848 --> 01:31:37,990
- Oh shut up, sandy vagina.
Come in and get drunk.

1036
01:31:43,892 --> 01:31:45,687
You're welcome.

1037
01:31:45,722 --> 01:31:46,550
- Thanks.

1038
01:31:50,934 --> 01:31:53,005
- That is so bad.

1039
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:55,007
- Hey, love. How were your
holidays?

1040
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:59,563
- Yeah, no, really good,
thanks. Really good, thanks.

1041
01:32:03,533 --> 01:32:04,810
- Oh

1042
01:32:04,844 --> 01:32:08,469
- Still not patched things up?

1043
01:32:08,503 --> 01:32:10,885
- Do you think it's
salvageable?

1044
01:32:10,919 --> 01:32:11,851
- It's you.

1045
01:32:14,164 --> 01:32:14,992
Come on.

1046
01:32:22,206 --> 01:32:24,001
- Hey stranger.

1047
01:32:24,036 --> 01:32:24,864
- Hey.

1048
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,108
- You okay?

1049
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:33,390
- As good as I can be,
deep in enemy territory.

1050
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,778
Look, is there any
chance that we can just -

1051
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:44,539
- We can maybe start again?

1052
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:48,750
- Yeah.

1053
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,654
I miss you, buddy.

1054
01:32:55,688 --> 01:32:56,551
- I miss you.

1055
01:33:01,004 --> 01:33:02,764
Everything okay?

1056
01:33:02,799 --> 01:33:04,110
- Yeah, yeah.

1057
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:05,698
- Happy new year, boys.

1058
01:33:05,733 --> 01:33:06,596
- Hey.

1059
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:14,914
- So, any new year's
resolutions?

1060
01:33:14,949 --> 01:33:16,502
- Yeah, one or two.

1061
01:33:18,642 --> 01:33:19,885
- Excuse me a sec.

1062
01:33:23,095 --> 01:33:24,510
- You should go for it man.

1063
01:33:24,545 --> 01:33:28,134
- Honestly, he's not interested.
He's not.

1064
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:29,619
Stop looking at me like that.

1065
01:33:29,653 --> 01:33:30,309
- What?

1066
01:33:30,343 --> 01:33:32,484
You know what you're doing.

1067
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:42,563
- Same again, boys?

1068
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:42,554
- Christ, I hate this.

1069
01:34:42,588 --> 01:34:45,764
- I know, and I'm
sorry, okay?

1070
01:34:56,084 --> 01:34:57,638
- Oh shit.

1071
01:34:57,672 --> 01:34:58,915
I'm so sorry.

1072
01:34:58,949 --> 01:35:00,157
- Fuck.

1073
01:35:00,192 --> 01:35:03,713
- It's okay, I didn't
see anything. Well, I did.

1074
01:35:03,747 --> 01:35:06,647
But I can pretend I didn't.
Okay, no, that's a lie too.

1075
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:10,029
- Pinky, please. Don't say
anything.

1076
01:35:10,064 --> 01:35:11,134
- Okay, okay.

1077
01:35:15,241 --> 01:35:16,104
Warren.

1078
01:35:17,105 --> 01:35:18,106
- Hi, Pinky.

1079
01:35:19,142 --> 01:35:20,143
- Please, Pink.

1080
01:35:20,177 --> 01:35:22,663
- It's okay, I won't.

1081
01:35:22,697 --> 01:35:25,769
I'm just going back downstairs.

1082
01:35:31,706 --> 01:35:35,779
It's just, I just came to get my
charger.

1083
01:35:39,093 --> 01:35:43,028
You know what? Nevermind.
I'll come back later.

1084
01:36:02,426 --> 01:36:04,739
- 10 minutes, boys.

1085
01:36:04,774 --> 01:36:06,741
- Let's get a group photo.

1086
01:36:06,776 --> 01:36:08,087
- Lovely people, Team
B,

1087
01:36:08,122 --> 01:36:11,815
let's get a final team photo of
the year.

1088
01:36:18,442 --> 01:36:19,133
Give me your phone, Pink.

1089
01:36:19,167 --> 01:36:21,342
Mine's plugged in for the music.

1090
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:22,688
- Mine's dead.

1091
01:36:23,413 --> 01:36:26,347
- You just went to
charge it.

1092
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:28,763
- It's fine, just use mine.

1093
01:36:36,806 --> 01:36:38,773
- You as well. Come on.

1094
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,378
- Three, two, one.

1095
01:36:57,412 --> 01:36:59,173
- Stags.

1096
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,420
- What the fuck did you say to
him?

1097
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:16,112
- Honestly, Mark.

1098
01:38:16,146 --> 01:38:19,425
It can't be easy for him to
compete for your attention,

1099
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:22,843
even when you only had one
boyfriend.

1100
01:38:22,877 --> 01:38:24,776
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1101
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:27,502
- I was doing him a favor,
really.

1102
01:38:40,515 --> 01:38:42,241
- Yeah, mate, you
can try and fucking run.

1103
01:38:42,276 --> 01:38:43,760
- Just leave it.

1104
01:38:43,795 --> 01:38:47,177
- Do you actually
care about anyone?

1105
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:48,385
The team?

1106
01:38:50,387 --> 01:38:51,526
Me?

1107
01:38:53,908 --> 01:38:56,911
- Twelve, eleven, ten...

1108
01:38:56,946 --> 01:38:58,775
- It's the
countdown, man. Come on.

1109
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:02,468
- Nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four,

1110
01:39:03,987 --> 01:39:07,232
three, two, one, happy new year.

1111
01:39:09,855 --> 01:39:12,030
- You fucking do it again
man! Fucking do it again -

1112
01:39:12,064 --> 01:39:13,307
- He isn't worth it.

1113
01:39:13,341 --> 01:39:14,826
- I'll kill him, you Fuck.
- Mate, mate,

1114
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,551
he's not worth it, look at me.

1115
01:39:16,586 --> 01:39:18,761
He's not worth it, yeah?

1116
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:43,233
- Well?

1117
01:39:46,202 --> 01:39:48,791
Are you going to say anything?

1118
01:39:57,213 --> 01:39:58,041
No.

1119
01:40:07,188 --> 01:40:08,431
- Maybe it's time you go sweet-

1120
01:40:08,465 --> 01:40:10,536
- Don't fucking touch me.

1121
01:40:22,997 --> 01:40:25,068
Happy fucking new year.

1122
01:41:34,241 --> 01:41:36,174
- Happy new year, baby.

1123
01:41:43,284 --> 01:41:44,976
- Rich, there's something that I
er-

1124
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,701
- It's okay.

1125
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:49,014
I already know.

1126
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:52,224
I know everything.

1127
01:41:54,778 --> 01:41:55,641
- Who?

1128
01:41:57,264 --> 01:41:58,644
- Does it matter?

1129
01:42:01,647 --> 01:42:03,063
- Richard, I don't know what to
say-

1130
01:42:03,097 --> 01:42:03,926
- Don't.

1131
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:06,583
Please.

1132
01:42:11,278 --> 01:42:12,486
- I'm so sorry.

1133
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:27,156
- I've made up a
bed in the spare room for you.

1134
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:30,676
You can pack your things in the
morning.

1135
01:45:39,693 --> 01:45:41,488
- no, that's a knock on,

1136
01:45:41,522 --> 01:45:43,317
and that's the ball game.

1137
01:46:19,422 --> 01:46:22,805
- Jimmy, can I have a
word?

1138
01:46:50,833 --> 01:46:52,559
- How have you been?

1139
01:46:53,801 --> 01:46:56,321
- Yeah. Yeah. No, good. Good.

1140
01:46:57,943 --> 01:46:58,944
Life's good.

1141
01:47:02,845 --> 01:47:04,743
- Barry is dropping the B team-

1142
01:47:04,778 --> 01:47:06,331
- Please don't, Pink.

1143
01:47:06,366 --> 01:47:06,987
- You can act like you don't
care-

1144
01:47:07,021 --> 01:47:07,884
- I don't.

1145
01:47:10,818 --> 01:47:12,579
Sorry.

1146
01:47:12,613 --> 01:47:14,822
I don't. Really.

1147
01:47:17,722 --> 01:47:19,931
It's not going to happen, okay?

1148
01:47:19,965 --> 01:47:21,415
So just drop it.

1149
01:47:24,591 --> 01:47:28,388
- I hated rugby in
school. Did you know that?

1150
01:47:31,045 --> 01:47:34,773
I was great at it, but
I hated every second.

1151
01:47:39,433 --> 01:47:42,505
Never thought I'd give it
another go.

1152
01:47:43,713 --> 01:47:45,922
Then I met all of you boys.

1153
01:47:48,131 --> 01:47:50,651
It was like finding a family.

1154
01:47:52,895 --> 01:47:54,483
Maybe being a Stag meant nothing
to you-

1155
01:47:54,517 --> 01:47:56,381
- This isn't fair, Pink.

1156
01:47:56,416 --> 01:47:58,797
- No, it isn't.

1157
01:48:05,148 --> 01:48:08,359
- Look, I'm sorry, okay? The
answer is no.

1158
01:48:16,643 --> 01:48:20,716
- Okay lads.
That's enough, let's go.

1159
01:48:27,757 --> 01:48:28,620
- Hey.

1160
01:48:32,935 --> 01:48:35,144
I need something from you.

1161
01:48:35,178 --> 01:48:36,732
- No way.

1162
01:48:38,147 --> 01:48:40,529
He doesn't want to see me.

1163
01:48:40,563 --> 01:48:42,738
- You owe us this.

1164
01:49:59,953 --> 01:50:01,437
- I can't stop thinking about
Christmas-

1165
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,680
- Stop.

1166
01:50:02,714 --> 01:50:04,578
- Next time, I'll even beat
your dad down the mountain-

1167
01:50:04,613 --> 01:50:08,858
- Warren, there won't be a
next time. You know that.

1168
01:50:14,933 --> 01:50:16,038
- I miss you.

1169
01:50:21,802 --> 01:50:23,770
- Why are we even here?

1170
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:30,535
Pinky spoke to you, didn't he?

1171
01:50:32,123 --> 01:50:34,125
- It really hurt that you never
answered.

1172
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,713
- I'm surprised you care.

1173
01:50:35,747 --> 01:50:37,093
- Don't say that.

1174
01:50:41,512 --> 01:50:42,616
Mark.

1175
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,688
I love you.

1176
01:50:51,107 --> 01:50:54,179
- And what good does that do me
now? Hmm?

1177
01:50:55,249 --> 01:50:56,837
- Why are you doing this?

1178
01:50:56,872 --> 01:51:00,082
- Why am I? Why are you, Warren?

1179
01:51:00,116 --> 01:51:04,189
What is it you want from
me? You had your chance.

1180
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:07,745
It's all just words now.

1181
01:51:13,923 --> 01:51:16,132
Does John know you're here?

1182
01:51:29,111 --> 01:51:31,562
- How did we get here, Mark?

1183
01:51:59,762 --> 01:52:01,557
- Pinky gave me this.

1184
01:52:09,013 --> 01:52:10,635
Don't punish them.

1185
01:53:26,193 --> 01:53:28,368
- You're a good man, Mark.

1186
01:54:28,221 --> 01:54:31,155
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1187
01:54:31,189 --> 01:54:33,398
Ready, Ready Ready, go!

1188
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:02,186
- It's been a
tough old season for us all,

1189
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:04,775
but we've got everything to
fight for.

1190
01:55:04,809 --> 01:55:07,329
Now, the powers that be might
not believe in you, but I do,

1191
01:55:07,363 --> 01:55:10,781
completely, and I know
that every one of you

1192
01:55:10,815 --> 01:55:12,783
believes in each other.

1193
01:55:12,817 --> 01:55:13,887
So lets show that today

1194
01:55:13,922 --> 01:55:16,338
- and lets show that to
everybody who's watching.

1195
01:55:16,372 --> 01:55:17,891
- Come on, boys. Let's do this.
Hands in.

1196
01:55:17,926 --> 01:55:19,168
Three, two, one.

1197
01:55:19,203 --> 01:55:20,480
- Stags!

1198
01:56:22,335 --> 01:56:23,819
- Come on, boys.

1199
01:56:30,412 --> 01:56:31,516
- Have I missed much?

1200
01:56:31,551 --> 01:56:34,416
- It's five all and they've
just called half-time.

1201
01:56:34,450 --> 01:56:36,418
- - Jimmy] We need to focus
and get some discipline, yeah?

1202
01:56:36,452 --> 01:56:37,453
Can we get some water?

1203
01:56:37,488 --> 01:56:38,316
- Water.

1204
01:56:38,351 --> 01:56:39,352
- Right, listen up,
guys.

1205
01:56:39,386 --> 01:56:40,629
Their backs are unfit.

1206
01:56:40,663 --> 01:56:42,596
They're relying on their forward
power.

1207
01:56:42,631 --> 01:56:45,047
Mr. Pink, you see that flanker
over there?

1208
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:46,048
- Which one?

1209
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:47,049
- The pretty one.

1210
01:56:47,084 --> 01:56:48,430
- Oh, yeah.

1211
01:56:48,464 --> 01:56:49,603
- Take him out.

1212
01:56:49,638 --> 01:56:51,088
- I think I can manage that.

1213
01:56:51,122 --> 01:56:52,192
- Right, listen up.

1214
01:56:52,227 --> 01:56:54,125
Mark, Henry, you let the
forwards to do their work.

1215
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:55,886
Then you're going to break
through the back line, all right?

1216
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,889
That is how we are going win it.
Come on.

1217
01:57:12,523 --> 01:57:13,835
- Long time.

1218
01:57:18,598 --> 01:57:21,359
- Do you actually
understand all these rules?

1219
01:57:21,394 --> 01:57:22,567
- First match?

1220
01:57:24,190 --> 01:57:27,952
Well, first of all,
they're laws, not rules,

1221
01:57:27,987 --> 01:57:29,505
- and no,

1222
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:32,439
but, I don't think anyone does.

1223
01:57:32,474 --> 01:57:34,925
Least of all, this ref.

1224
01:57:36,927 --> 01:57:39,032
- Oh you are so mine.

1225
01:57:45,659 --> 01:57:46,764
- - Referee] High tackle.

1226
01:57:46,798 --> 01:57:51,217
- That's not quite
what I meant, Mr. Pink.

1227
01:57:53,633 --> 01:57:56,187
- - Supporter] They're
one player down, now.

1228
01:57:56,222 --> 01:57:58,914
Five minutes left. Still a tie.

1229
01:57:58,949 --> 01:58:00,191
- Ladies, focus.

1230
01:58:00,226 --> 01:58:02,504
Henry, you got this.

1231
01:59:41,396 --> 01:59:43,329
- - Jimmy] Come on,
guys. It's not over yet.

1232
01:59:43,363 --> 01:59:44,226
Carlos.

1233
01:59:45,641 --> 01:59:47,678
- Wait, give it to Henry.

1234
01:59:48,713 --> 01:59:50,784
- - Jimmy] Well done, Henry.

1235
02:00:51,707 --> 02:00:56,712
- Thought I would finally see
what all the fuss was about.

1236
02:00:57,196 --> 02:00:58,542
- It means a lot.

1237
02:01:18,769 --> 02:01:22,083
I am sorry. I never meant to
hurt you.

1238
02:01:25,258 --> 02:01:26,535
- It's getting late.

1239
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:31,678
- Look, maybe we can go for a
drink or something, sometime?

1240
02:01:31,713 --> 02:01:35,613
- I'm really glad I got
to see you play, Mark.

1241
02:01:37,788 --> 02:01:39,479
- - Jimmy] Where's Mark?

1242
02:01:39,514 --> 02:01:40,653
- Mark.

1243
02:01:40,687 --> 02:01:41,550
Come on.

1244
02:01:43,621 --> 02:01:44,622
- It's okay.

1245
02:01:45,968 --> 02:01:46,797
Go.

1246
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:17,172
- Look at them.

1247
02:02:20,486 --> 02:02:25,249
You never really understood
how we used to win, did you?

1248
02:02:25,284 --> 02:02:28,425
But it was never about being the
best.

1249
02:02:57,316 --> 02:02:58,455
- Are we okay?

1250
02:03:00,664 --> 02:03:02,390
- We can work on it.

1251
02:03:16,024 --> 02:03:16,852
- Mark.

1252
02:03:17,819 --> 02:03:20,960
Mark, wait. Please.

1253
02:03:22,927 --> 02:03:23,928
Can we talk?

1254
02:03:38,874 --> 02:03:43,672
That was the best I've
ever seen you play, today.

1255
02:03:43,707 --> 02:03:45,018
- Thanks.

1256
02:03:45,053 --> 02:03:47,297
- I'm glad you came back.

1257
02:03:53,095 --> 02:03:55,995
John wanted to come
down and support Henry.

1258
02:03:56,029 --> 02:03:58,377
And um,

1259
02:03:58,411 --> 02:03:59,585
well,

1260
02:03:59,619 --> 02:04:03,692
- I just wanted to see the
old place for one last time.

1261
02:04:05,384 --> 02:04:07,006
- What do you mean?

1262
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,665
- Me and John are leaving the
club.

1263
02:04:10,699 --> 02:04:12,874
It's probably for the best.

1264
02:04:16,981 --> 02:04:18,776
Now, I'm not so sure.

1265
02:04:21,538 --> 02:04:22,849
Seeing you this week again-

1266
02:04:22,884 --> 02:04:23,747
- Warren.

1267
02:04:25,611 --> 02:04:29,615
- I could go and end it
with him now, right now.

1268
02:04:31,341 --> 02:04:33,515
We could try again,
but properly this time-

1269
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:34,378
- Please.

1270
02:04:38,071 --> 02:04:41,903
I really appreciate you coming
today.

1271
02:04:41,937 --> 02:04:42,800
I do.

1272
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:48,461
Look, I just...

1273
02:04:51,706 --> 02:04:52,948
We lost our way.

1274
02:05:00,439 --> 02:05:02,993
- And I think I've found it
again now.

1275
02:05:30,469 --> 02:05:31,987
- I've got to go.

1276
02:05:35,474 --> 02:05:36,613
Come here.

1277
02:07:28,725 --> 02:07:30,796
- Boys!

1278
02:07:36,008 --> 02:07:37,941
- Nice yellow card today.

1279
02:07:37,975 --> 02:07:39,494
- Oh, fuck.

1280
02:07:41,531 --> 02:07:44,775
- Ladies and gentleman,

1281
02:07:44,810 --> 02:07:46,501
- Thank you.

1282
02:07:47,675 --> 02:07:50,850
Firstly, I'd like to express
our sincere gratitude

1283
02:07:50,885 --> 02:07:53,163
to the Rochester boys
for coming down today,

1284
02:07:53,197 --> 02:07:55,683
and providing us with such
spirited

1285
02:07:55,717 --> 02:07:57,512
and sporting opposition.

1286
02:07:57,547 --> 02:07:58,755
So thank you.

1287
02:08:03,069 --> 02:08:04,830
Though I must say it feels
pretty good

1288
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:09,524
to have reclaimed the
honour today, on this day,

1289
02:08:09,559 --> 02:08:12,562
the day of our final match
together.

1290
02:08:13,597 --> 02:08:17,221
Our final match together this
season.

1291
02:08:17,256 --> 02:08:21,674
And I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank Stuart,

1292
02:08:21,709 --> 02:08:25,747
and each and every one of
my teammates, even Gareth.

1293
02:08:27,853 --> 02:08:30,062
My rugby family.

1294
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:37,241
For reminding me, over
the course of this season,

1295
02:08:37,276 --> 02:08:40,831
what this game of rugby is
really about.

1296
02:08:40,866 --> 02:08:42,143
So thank you.

1297
02:08:43,213 --> 02:08:44,973
And now, for our man of the
match.

1298
02:08:45,008 --> 02:08:46,906
It was a tough call this week,

1299
02:08:46,941 --> 02:08:48,183
but I'd like to give it
to someone who I think

1300
02:08:48,218 --> 02:08:52,256
we all know has had his fair
share struggles off the pitch.

1301
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:54,258
He never fails to put that
aside,

1302
02:08:54,293 --> 02:08:58,193
and give himself 100%
when he's on the pitch,

1303
02:08:58,228 --> 02:08:59,747
hungover or not.

1304
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:01,196
Henry Michaels.

1305
02:09:10,999 --> 02:09:13,001
One non-alcoholic pint.

1306
02:09:15,003 --> 02:09:17,765
And now, for our dick of the
day.

1307
02:09:17,799 --> 02:09:21,078
We all know him. We all
still love him anyway.

1308
02:09:21,113 --> 02:09:23,046
He managed to get another
yellow card today.

1309
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,737
He may just be our dick of the
season.

1310
02:09:24,772 --> 02:09:27,602
He is our dick of the season.
Mr. Pink.

1311
02:09:31,364 --> 02:09:33,919
- You fuckers. I hate you all.

1312
02:09:38,406 --> 02:09:42,203
- He is a stag
lad, he is a stag lad,

1313
02:09:43,445 --> 02:09:47,311
he shouts it proudly,
night and day, hey, hey!

1314
02:09:47,346 --> 02:09:50,970
He's never lonely when we are
with him,

1315
02:09:51,005 --> 02:09:53,870
and he knows how to put a pint
away,

1316
02:09:53,904 --> 02:09:57,183
pint away, pint away,
pint away, pint away,

1317
02:09:57,218 --> 02:10:00,635
pint away, pint away,
pint away, pint away,

1318
02:10:00,670 --> 02:10:02,326
pint away, pint away.

1319
02:10:14,753 --> 02:10:15,857
- Here he is!

1320
02:10:15,892 --> 02:10:17,410
- Don't you fucking dare.

1321
02:10:18,305 --> 02:11:18,315
